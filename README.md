# Users-info
Gather user information, present it, and verify if they qualify for a discount.


# Problem

Write a Java program SurnameExam that will perform the following tasks:

Ask the user to input the following information:

Name (String), Age (int), Gender (String), Address (String), Week (String)
Using a switch-case statement, check the day of the week and print a corresponding message:

If the day is Monday, print "Happy Monday" followed by the user's name.
If the day is Tuesday, print "Happy Tuesday" followed by the user's name.
Continue for the rest of the days from Wednesday to Sunday.
If the input does not match any day of the week, print "Invalid Input".
Using if-else statements, implement the following discount logic:

If the user is 20 years old or younger, give them a 30% discount.
If the user's address contains the word "Tarlac", give them a 10% discount.
If both conditions are satisfied, give the user a 40% discount.
If none of the conditions are met, no discount is available.
Display the results: Show the user's name, age, gender, address, and the day of the week.

Display the final discount amount based on the conditions above or indicate "No discount available."
